:::note

If you are running Kubernetes v1.24 or earlier, and have a [Pod Security Policy](../../new-user-guides/authentication-permissions-and-global-configuration/create-pod-security-policies.md) (PSP) hardened cluster, Compliance 4.0.0 and later disable PSPs by default. To install Compliance on a PSP-hardened cluster, set `global.psp.enabled` to `true` in the values before installing the chart. [Pod Security Admission](../../new-user-guides/authentication-permissions-and-global-configuration/pod-security-standards.md) (PSA) hardened clusters aren't affected.
